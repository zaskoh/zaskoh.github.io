        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I am a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience, focusing on backend development and e-commerce. My skills include expertise in AWS, Golang, Solidity using frameworks like Foundry, Hardhat, and Ethers.js, Bash, Docker, REST API, Git, PHP with a focus on Laravel and MySQL. I have a strong background in delivering multiple projects in the e-commerce domain. With my technical skills, I have a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle, and I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and modern software development practices. I am also interested in web3, solidity, EVM, blockchain, crypto, and security. My goal for 2023 is to make a shift to web3 as a security researcher and solidity auditor.</p>

<h1 id="interests-and-goals">Interests and Goals</h1>
<p>My interests lie in web3, solidity, EVM, blockchain, crypto, and security. I am particularly interested in EVM blockchain security research and auditing smart contracts. Currently active on Code4rena, Sherlock, and Immunify. My goal for 2023 is to make a shift to web3 as a security researcher and solidity auditor.</p>

<h1 id="achievements-in-the-web3-space">Achievements in the Web3 Space</h1>
<p>I have built a DEX arbitrage bot that can trade on UniswapV3 and UniswapV2, as well as its forks. Additionally, I have built an NFT arbitrage bot that can trade on OpenSea and LooksRare. While both bots are currently not open-sourced, I plan to open-source them in the future.</p>

<p>Starting in November 2022, I decided to make a shift to auditing smart contracts and in my first contests on Code4rena, I was able to identify medium and high findings. I am eager to continue enhancing my skills in this area.</p>
