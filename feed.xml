<h2 id="january-audit-results">January audit results</h2>

<p>First off, let me share my January contest results. All my findings have been released and I’m proud to say that I did 5 contests (4x code4rena, 1x Sherlock) and made $5436 with 62 hours of work. I found 5 high and 8 medium findings, all in all I would say it was a good month.</p>

<h2 id="30days-challenge-experience">#30days Challenge Experience</h2>

<p>Now, let’s talk about February. I didn’t participate in any code4rena or Sherlock contests this month, but I participated in the #30days challenge from @Web3SecurityDAO and it pushed me to do at least one hour of research every day, and I discovered some awesome resources that I want to share with you.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Spearbit/videos">Spearbit’s</a> videos on YouTube are a must watch. So much alpha - highly recommended!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Picodes/4naly3er">4naly3er</a> from Picodes - it’s an amazing tool and I try to contribute back by adding findings I don’t want to include in my reports. Last month, I contributed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Solmate's SafeTransferLib does not check for token contract's existence</code> finding and some configuration options.</li>
  <li><a href="https://proxies.yacademy.dev/">Proxies research</a> by yacademy is a must read. It’s one of the best summaries I’ve come across.</li>
  <li>Chisel from Foundry is amazing and can help speed up some processes. I somtimes struggle to remember to use it for simple checks, but it’s one of the best optimizations I’ve found.</li>
  <li>I also spent a lot of time reading old reports. I <a href="https://github.com/zaskoh/audit-reports">open-sourced</a> this repo. With it I can get a Discord update and add it to my to-do list for reading the report. It scans for new code4rena and Sherlock audit reports that were released.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quillctf.super.site/challenges">The QuillCTF</a> was a fun weekly challenge. Some were challenging, some were easy, but it’s a nice format. I think I’ll continue to participate in it.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://immunefi.com/explore/?filter=immunefi">Immunify</a>. Zobront open-sourced quickpoc and I adapted it so it’s possible to use it on every chain. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/zaskoh/quickpoc">Github</a>. It helps to easily spin up a project with all the inscope files. I went through about 3-4 projects in total, but didn’t find anything that was in scope to report.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reflecting-on-february">Reflecting on February:</h2>

<p>All in all, February was a research-heavy month for me. I missed some of my goals, but I still think it was a worthwhile experience. One of my main goals was to be more active on Twitter and connect with more security researchers. The #30days challenge helped me with posting on Twitter and I joined the Solidity Lab from https://guardianaudits.com/, where I joined the verified auditors and will try to be active on this community.</p>

<h2 id="my-goals-for-march">My Goals for March</h2>

<p>For March, I plan to participate in every new QuillCTF, focus more on code4rena and Sherlock audits, and be active on the Solidity Lab community. Simple, but effective. Let’s go!</p>]]></content><author><name>zaskoh</name></author><category term="recap" /><category term="code4rena" /><category term="sherlock" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks!

<p>Hey folks! I’m back with an update on my journey to becoming a solidity auditor. January was a busy month and I wanted to share my progress and challenges with you all.</p>

<p>I participated in 4 code4rena contests and my first Sherlock contest. I spent an average of 10-12 hours per contest, totaling around 50 hours. I found 8 high and 11 medium vulnerabilities and improved my QA reports a lot, still it was very challenging to balance this all with my job.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned-from-a-low-severity-finding-on-immunify">Lessons Learned from a Low Severity Finding on immunify</h2>

<p>Submitted one low severity finding to immunify, but unfortunately, it was closed with a “we know and don’t care” response. While it was a bit of a bummer, I took it as a learning opportunity and have since prioritized my research to focus on larger codebases.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenges-of-auditing-large-codebases">The Challenges of Auditing Large Codebases</h2>

<p>One thing I learned in January was that larger codebases are super challenging to audit in the limited time I spent per audit. I think I could do better if I had more time per contest, especially when dealing with codebases larger than 500 SLOC.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-february">Goals for February</h2>

<p>For February, I’ve set some new goals for myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participate in fewer contests, but allocate more time to each one</li>
  <li>Dedicate at least 10 hours to one immunify project to get my first bounty</li>
  <li>Go through all of the audit reports I’ve accumulated to continue sharpening my skills</li>
  <li>Take more time for leaning and research and go through all audit reports I have on my list</li>
  <li>Be more active on Twitter and connect with more security researchers</li>
  <li>Make a post about my MEV journey and open source my first bot</li>
  <li>Submit a CTF to QuillAudits showcasing a real attack that my MEV bot suffered from, or share a post about what I learned from the experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it for now!</p>

<p>I’m excited to continue my journey in the security and auditing space, and I hope you’ll join me for the ride.

<p>Hey folks, welcome to my blog! I’m a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience in the e-commerce industry, focusing on backend development. A year and a half ago, I stumbled upon the world of web3 and blockchain and couldn’t resist the pull. I built an arbitrage bot and at the end of 2022, I realized that the real excitement was in the security aspect of smart contracts. So, I set my sights on becoming a security researcher and solidity auditor.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>

<p>I dove headfirst into the world of smart contract security and quickly found myself participating in CTFs and learning all I could about the space. I discovered Code4rena, Sherlock, and Immunify and started submitting my findings. My goal for 2023 is to continue sharpening my skills and participating in more audits. I also plan on joining Yacademy and Spearbit to further my knowledge and network in the security and auditing community.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-my-journey-to-becoming-a-solidity-auditor">Sharing My Journey to Becoming a Solidity Auditor</h2>

<p>In the coming months, I’ll be sharing my journey with you all. From my first steps with my arbitrage bot to my transition into smart contract security and the resources I found helpful. I’ll also be sharing my experiences in CTFs and my progress in becoming a smart contract auditor.</p>

<h2 id="connect-with-the-security-and-auditing-community">Connect with the Security and Auditing Community</h2>

<p>I’m always open to discussions and would love to connect with the security and auditing community.
