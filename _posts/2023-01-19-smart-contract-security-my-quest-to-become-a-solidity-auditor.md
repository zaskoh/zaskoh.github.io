## From E-commerce to Blockchain

Hey folks, welcome to my blog! I'm a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience in the e-commerce industry, focusing on backend development. A year and a half ago, I stumbled upon the world of web3 and blockchain and couldn't resist the pull. I built an arbitrage bot and at the end of 2022, I realized that the real excitement was in the security aspect of smart contracts. So, I set my sights on becoming a security researcher and solidity auditor.

## My Journey

I dove headfirst into the world of smart contract security and quickly found myself participating in CTFs and learning all I could about the space. I discovered Code4rena, Sherlock, and Immunify and started submitting my findings. My goal for 2023 is to continue sharpening my skills and participating in more audits. I also plan on joining Yacademy and Spearbit to further my knowledge and network in the security and auditing community.

## Sharing My Journey to Becoming a Solidity Auditor

In the coming months, I'll be sharing my journey with you all. From my first steps with my arbitrage bot to my transition into smart contract security and the resources I found helpful. I'll also be sharing my experiences in CTFs and my progress in becoming a smart contract auditor.

## Connect with the Security and Auditing Community

I'm always open to discussions and would love to connect with the security and auditing community. If you're interested in following my journey, getting updates on my projects and research, or just want to chat and share ideas, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xzaskoh) or Discord (zaskoh#2073 in Code4rena).

See you in the next post!
