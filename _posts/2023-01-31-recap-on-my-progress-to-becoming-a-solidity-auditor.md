## Balancing Work and Contests

Hey folks! I'm back with an update on my journey to becoming a solidity auditor. January was a busy month and I wanted to share my progress and challenges with you all.

I participated in 4 code4rena contests and my first Sherlock contest. I spent an average of 10-12 hours per contest, totaling around 50 hours. I found 8 high and 11 medium vulnerabilities and improved my QA reports a lot, still it was very challenging to balance this all with my job.

## Lessons Learned from a Low Severity Finding on immunify

Submitted one low severity finding to immunify, but unfortunately, it was closed with a "we know and don't care" response. While it was a bit of a bummer, I took it as a learning opportunity and have since prioritized my research to focus on larger codebases.

## The Challenges of Auditing Large Codebases

One thing I learned in January was that larger codebases are super challenging to audit in the limited time I spent per audit. I think I could do better if I had more time per contest, especially when dealing with codebases larger than 500 SLOC.

## Goals for February

For February, I've set some new goals for myself:

- Participate in fewer contests, but allocate more time to each one
- Dedicate at least 10 hours to one immunify project to get my first bounty
- Go through all of the audit reports I've accumulated to continue sharpening my skills
- Take more time for leaning and research and go through all audit reports I have on my list
- Be more active on Twitter and connect with more security researchers
- Make a post about my MEV journey and open source my first bot
- Submit a CTF to QuillAudits showcasing a real attack that my MEV bot suffered from, or share a post about what I learned from the experience.


That's it for now! 

I'm excited to continue my journey in the security and auditing space, and I hope you'll join me for the ride. If you're interested in following my progress, connecting with me, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xzaskoh) or Discord (zaskoh#2073 in Code4rena).

See you in the next post!
